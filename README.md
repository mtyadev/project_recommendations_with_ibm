# project_recommendations_with_ibm
Building a recommendation engine for articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform. The goal is to leverage machine learning best practices to suggest new articles users will like given their platform usage.  

# Installation

* No local installation is required. 
* You can follow along the jupyter notebook "Recommendations_With_IBM.ipynb" explaining how I went about to build the recommendation engine  based on the available raw data

# Project Motivation

As part of the udacity <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025">data scientist nano degree programm</a> I am developing the recommendation engine, show-casing the following approaches:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
